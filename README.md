# Muharem Hrnjadovic: curriculum vitae

# About me
I have held positions that involved some degree of technical leadership (senior/principal engineer, software development manager, director of engineering, CTO) [for a decade now](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/mhrnjad).
My top 3 strenghts are as follows:
 * building, developing and running high-performance teams (local and/or remote)
 * providing technology leadership and guidance to the entire organisation (based on 20+ years of software development experience)
 * building IT systems

# My skills
## People / culture
 * hiring, mentoring, empowering
 * setting direction
 * establishing a culture of experimentation, iterative development, quality and delivery

## Product / project
 * collaborating in product definitions
 * breaking products / services down to technical requirements
 * running the feedback loop between the technical / business team

## Information technology
### Programming languages
 * Python: 6+ years of experience, see e.g. the [OpenQuake engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) for some samples of my work
 * erlang: solid knowledge and [some code experiments](https://github.com/freizeit/exercises/tree/master/cj-a-store-credit/erlang)
 * elixir: solid knowledge, also wrote a couple of small tools using it.
   Here's an [example](https://github.com/arbeit/mmt)

### Operating systems
Various linuxes e.g. Ubuntu, Arch

### Miscellaneous skills
 * Cloud computing: AWS and OpenStack. Here's an [AWS proof of concept](https://github.com/freizeit/auto-scaling-demo) I was asked to develop some time ago
 * Postgres: have extensive hands-on experience with it. I was the "database guy" in more than one project :)
 * RabbitMQ: used it quite a bit in the OpenQuake project, did most of the trouble-shooting and debugging on the distributed computation cluster.
 * Automation & deployment: I know of tools like puppet, ansible etc. and have dabbled with them. Have also played with docker more recently.

## Social
## Remote work
I have worked remotely and/or with remote teams for 5+ years. This is my preferred modus operandi.

### Agile teams
I have built and led a number of agile and distributed software development teams in the last couple of years

### Community
 * initiated and ran the [biggest IT meetup group in Zurich](http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/) for a number of years
 * co-founded the [Swiss OpenStack user group](http://www.meetup.com/openstack-ch/)

# Opinions and prejudices

 * the perfect is the enemy of good
 * untested code is broken code
 * automate or die!
