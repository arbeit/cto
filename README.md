 * building systems

# My skills

 * establishing an engineering culture of quality, experimentation, iterative development and delivery

## Product / project
 * collaborating in product definitions
 * breaking products / services down to technical requirements
 * running the feedback / feasibility loop between the technical / business team

## Programming languages
 * Python: 6+ years of experience, see e.g. the [OpenQuake engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine) for some samples of my work
 * erlang: solid knowledge and [some code experiments](https://github.com/freizeit/exercises/tree/master/cj-a-store-credit/erlang)
 * elixir: solid knowledge, also wrote a couple of small tools using it.

 * Postgres: have extensive hands-on experience with it. I was the "database guy" in more than one project :)
 * RabbitMQ: used it quite a bit in the OpenQuake project, did most of the trouble-shooting and debugging on the distributed computation cluster.
 * Automation & deployment: I know of tools like puppet, ansible etc. and have dabbled with them. Have also played with docker more recently.

## Social
### Agile teams
I have built and led a number of agile and distributed software development teams in the last couple of years

### Community
 * I started and ran the [biggest IT meetup group in Zurich](http://www.meetup.com/zhgeeks/) for a number of years
 * I was one of the founders the [Swiss OpenStack user group](http://www.meetup.com/openstack-ch/)

# Opinions and prejudices

 * perfect is the enemy of good
 * untested code is broken code
 * automate or die!
